# ⚠️ Should this be an ADR?
Are you in doubt if this document you or your team propose needs to be an Architectural Decision Record?

Let's check it through several questions 😊

Starting with a `stop question`:

* ❓ Is this ADR related to a change in this specific application or service?
  ✋ **If** the answer **is "no"**, which means that this ADR affects this application and others, **end this document here** and start writing a general Decision Record [here](https://sequra.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3771039771/Tech+Decision+Records#List-of-Tech-Decision-Records)
  👇 **If** the previous **answer is a "yes"**

Let's **continue** with these other questions:

* ❓ Will this ADR provoke a breaking changes or sensible modifications inside this application or services' engine, interfaces, APIs or [seams](https://archive.org/details/working-effectively-with-legacy-code/page/n51/mode/2up) `(look into chapter 4 of this book for the reference)` between domains?
* ❓ Will this ADR introduce new architectural or software design patterns in the project (f.ex: big refactors which provide that an old feature can work in a new way, introducing a new technology/gem/package/etc ...)
* ❓ Will this ADR impact other teams’ roadmaps or velocities meaningfully?
* ❓ Does this ADR imply different approaches/options for which you want/need the opinion of the rest of the team?
* ❓ Does this ADR modify/impact another existing or very similar ADR (superseeding or refining it)?

Then, evaluate your answers:

* 👉  If you checked any of those boxes, this topic does need an ADR.
* 👉  If you didn’t check any of those boxes, doing an ADR is optional.

**❗  Depending on your decision, either delete this section or delete this document!**
